"""Framework-agnostic interface for analytics metadata.

Detection / classification / tracking results are attached to a buffer as
analytics metadata. GStreamer expresses this via `GstAnalytics` relation
metadata. Elements should go through this interface instead of calling the
framework API directly, so the same element code can run on a different backend
later.

The `meta` handle and the detection handles returned by `add_*` are opaque to
callers: pass them back into the same backend (e.g. into `relate`). The read
side (`read_objects`) returns plain dicts so consumers need no framework types.
