"""Backend-agnostic OCR task.

`OcrTask` runs text recognition and turns the result into an optional output
frame (recognized text drawn on the frame) plus a serialized metadata blob
(JSON with recognized text and regions), using only numpy/cv2 and the engine.
It never touches the buffer; the backend element shell does the frame read, the
frame write, and the metadata attach through the frameio facade.

Contract expected from the host element:
  self.engine     - the ML engine (provided by MLEngineMixin)
  self.logger     - logger
  self.draw_text  - bool, draw recognized text on the frame (a property)
